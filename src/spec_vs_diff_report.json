  "summary": "Diff adds a TanStack Router-based multi-page frontend with shared Header/Footer layout, several content modules (home/about/faq/testimonials/services/blog posts), section components (About/Why Choose Us, FAQ accordion, Testimonials grid), hooks for submitting/leads querying, and a Motoko backend actor with lead submission + admin-only lead listing. However, several BuildRequest requirements are not evidenced in the diff summary (notably stable persistence/ack for leads, required CTAs/WhatsApp message requirements, and multiple page implementations/content counts), and some unrequested features (social links, admin access-control/secret-token initialization) appear.",

      "reason": "Header shows “Book Free Consultation” and “Talk to Tax Expert”, but there is no evidence of the “File Your ITR Now” CTA anywhere. Also, the WhatsApp message shown ('I would like to talk to a tax expert') does not include the required phrase “Online Tax Consultant” in the visible code.",

      "reason": "Routing for services and service detail exists and a services content module exists, but the diff summary does not show the ServicesPage/ServiceDetailPage implementations, and the services list is truncated—cannot confirm exactly 7 services are present nor that detail pages render keywords/content and include CTAs.",
